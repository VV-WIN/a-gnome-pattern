# a-gnome-pattern
A game inspired by an encounter at the lake with my partner and our dog where we encountered a rock maze and a gnome.  

## General Gameplay and Mechanics
Using the directional keys or alternatively wasd, simply walk the pattern.

## Personal Goals
To quite the fear that tells me I *can't*. You **can** and **will** do this. I belive in you, me. xoxo
