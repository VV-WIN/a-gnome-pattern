# a-gnome-pattern
A game inspired by a moment at the lake with my partner and our dog where we encountered a rock maze and a gnome.  

## General Gameplay and Mechanics
Using the directional keys or WASD, simply walk the pattern.

## Personal Goals
To quiet the fear that tells me I *can't*. You **can** and **will** do this. I believe in you, me. xoxo
